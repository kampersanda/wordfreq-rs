# wordfreq-rs

This library is a yet another Rust port of [wordfreq](https://github.com/rspeer/wordfreq),
allowing you to look up the frequencies of words in many languages.

## Repository structure

This repository contains three crates:

- [wordfreq](wordfreq) is a crate that provides an API to lookup word frequencies.
- [wordfreq-model](wordfreq-model) is a crate that provides a loader for pre-compiled wordfreq models.
- [wordfreq-example](wordfreq-example) is a crate that provides an example program.

## Getting started

We recommend to see the [documentation of wordfreq-model](https://docs.rs/wordfreq-model/) for quick start.
Then, [wordfreq-example](wordfreq-example) will be helpful to understand the behavior of this library.
More detailed specifications are available in the [documentation of wordfreq](https://docs.rs/wordfreq/).
