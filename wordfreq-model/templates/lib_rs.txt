//! # wordfreq-model
//!
//! This crate provides a loader for pre-compiled wordfreq models,
//! allowing you to easily create [`WordFreq`] instances for various languages.
//!
//! ## Instructions
//!
//! The provided models are the same as those distributed in the original Python package.
//! See the [original documentation](https://github.com/rspeer/wordfreq/tree/v3.0.2#sources-and-supported-languages)
//! for the supported languages and their sources.
//!
//! You need to specify models you want to use with `features`.
//! The feature names are in the form of `large-xx` or `small-xx`, where `xx` is the language code.
//! For example, if you want to use the large-English and small-Japanese models,
//! specify `large-en` and `small-ja` as follows:
//!
//! ```toml
//! # Cargo.toml
//!
//! [dependencies.wordfreq-model]
//! version = "0.1"
//! default-features = false
//! features = ["large-en", "small-ja"]
//! ```
//!
//! By default, only `small-en` is enabled.
//!
//! ## Examples
//!
//! [`load_wordfreq`] can create a [`WordFreq`] instance from a [`ModelKind`] enum value.
//! [`ModelKind`] will have the specified feature names in CamelCase.
//!
//! ```
//! use wordfreq_model::load_wordfreq;
//! use wordfreq_model::ModelKind;
//!
//! let wf = load_wordfreq(ModelKind::SmallEn).unwrap();
//! println!("{{:?}}", wf.word_frequency("cafe"));
//! // => 1.2838035e-5
//! println!("{{:?}}", wf.zipf_frequency("cafe"));
//! // => 4.11
//! ```
//!
//! ## Notes
//!
//! This crate embeds models directly into the source code.
//! Specify as many models as you need to avoid bloating your binary.
